# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Support for 16-bit words with SPI ([#107](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/107))
- SPI support for reclock after initialization ([#98](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/98))

## [v0.5.0] - 2020-07-21

### Added

- Implement `InputPin` for `Output<OpenDrain>` pins ([#114](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/114))
- Support for safe one-shot DMA transfers ([#86](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/86))
- DMA support for serial reception and transmission ([#86](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/86))
- ADC support for `stm32f303` devices ([#47](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/47))

### Fixed

- `PLL` was calculated wrong for devices, which do not divide `HSI` ([#67](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/67))

### Changed

- The system clock calculation is more fine grained now. ([#67](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/67))
  Now the system clock can be some value, like 14 MHz, which can not a
  be represented as a multiple of the oscillator clock:
```rust
let clocks = rcc
    .cfgr
    .use_hse(8.mhz())
    .sysclk(14.mhz())

// or
let clocks = rcc
    .cfgr
    .use_hse(32.mhz())
    .sysclk(72.mhz())
```
  This is possible through utilizing the divider, which can divide the
  external oscillator clock on most devices. Some devices have even the
  possibility to divide the internal oscillator clock.

### Breaking changes

- The feature gate requires you to select a subvariant if possible. ([#75](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/75))
- Split up `stm32f302` into sub-targets `stm32f302xb`,`stm32f302xc`,`stm32f302xd`,`stm32f302xe`
- Bump `stm32f3` dependency to `0.11.0` ([#97](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/97))
- The `stm32f3` reexport is now renamed from `stm32` to `pac` ([#101](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/101))
- The correct `stm32f3` modules are now used for the `stm32f318` and `stm32f738`
  targets. As a result, some previously (wrongly) supported peripherals have
  been removed from these targets. ([#116](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/116))

## [v0.4.3] - 2020-04-11

### Fixed

  higher than 64 ([#42](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/42))
- UART reception error flags not cleared ([#91](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/91))

- Use automatic mode with I2C autoend on `Read` ([#72](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/72))

### Changed

- Bump `stm32f3` dependency to `0.10.0` ([#70](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/70))

## [v0.4.1] - 2020-03-07

### Added

## [v0.4.0] - 2019-12-27

### Added

- USB Driver for all devices except `stm32f301` and `stm32f334` as they have no
  USB peripheral. ([#24](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/24))

### Breaking changes

  ([#21](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/21))
- `stm32f303` is now split into `stm32f303xd` and `stm32f303xe` as they provide
  different alternate gpio functions. `stm32f303` is still available.
