## [Unreleased]

### Added

- USB Driver for all devices except `stm32f301` and `stm32f334` as they have no
  USB peripheral. ([#24](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/24))
- `StatefulOutputPin` and `ToggleableOutputPin` ([#25](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/25))
- Support devices with 2-bit PLLSRC fields
  - This allow using 72 MHz `sysclk` on the `stm32f303`
- Analog gpio trait ([#33](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/33))
- Add PWM Channels ([#34](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/34))

### Breaking changes

- Alternate gpio functions are now made only available for devices, which have them.
  ([#21](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/pull/21))
- `stm32f303` is now split into `stm32f303xd` and `stm32f303xe` as they provide
  different alternate gpio functions. `stm32f303` is still available.
