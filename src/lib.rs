 # Selecting the right chip

   This crate requires you to specify your target chip as a feature.

   Please select one of the following

   (Note: `x` denotes any character in [a-z])
   *   stm32f301
   *   stm32f318
   *   stm32f302xb
   *   stm32f302xc
   *   stm32f302xd
   *   stm32f302xe
   *   stm32f302x6
   *   stm32f302x8
   *   stm32f303xb
   *   stm32f303xc
   *   stm32f303xd
   *   stm32f303xe
   *   stm32f303x6
   *   stm32f303x8
   *   stm32f373
   *   stm32f378
   *   stm32f334
   *   stm32f328
   *   stm32f358
   *   stm32f398

   Example: The STM32F3Discovery board has a STM32F303VCT6 chip.
   So you want to expand your call to `cargo` with `--features stm32f303xc`.

   For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal/blob/master/README.md#selecting-the-right-chip)
