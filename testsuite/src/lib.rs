# Testsuite

This testsuite module defines the test setup via the pin type setup.

Because of the ease of use, the tests are written for the STM32F3Discovery board.

To easier run any test on other hardware, some type abstractions are provided.
In most cases, many pins are pairs of GPIOs connected to each other,
so that one one pin can confirm the correct behavior of the other pin and the underlying
peripheral.
